abstract = {HLA, the coding genes of human major histocompatibility (MHC) proteins, play a crucial role in the human adaptive immune system by presenting antigenic peptides to T cell receptors on T cells. HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C, these 3 Class I HLA genes are one of the most polymorphic loci in the human genome. For decades, HLA typing has been performed prior to tissue and stem cell transplantation. However, beyond the role in tissue matching, HLA has also been implicated in a wide array of autoimmune diseases and HLA genotypes and expression levels are closely associated with cancer patients prognosis as recent studies have revealed. Recently methods have been developed to perform HLA typing and HLA expression quantification together by using RNA-seq techniques. However, these bulk RNA-seq experiments are measuring an averaged signal of cell populations. Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) has regained its popularity due to its power to reliably resolve single RNA transcriptomes at large scales. In our present study, we did HLA typing using three independent scRNA-seq datasets. Interestingly, we found that single cells from the same donor could be classified into different groups where each group has a distinct expressed HLA genotype (e.g., HLA-A, heterozygous or homozygous); in other words, HLA class I genes show abundant allele specific expression in single cells. This phenomenon has been repeatedly observed in a total of 14 donors from 3 independent datasets (one is breast epithelium, another two are multiple myeloma). Our systematic analysis of HLA class I gene expression using multiple scRNA-seq datasets has uncovered a putative mechanism, where by fine tuning HLA class I expressions both at the quantity and allele levels, our immune system is able to handle various internal challenges through single cells equipped with extraordinary diverse HLA expression patterns.},

However, the extent to which patient-specific HLA-I genotype influences response to anti-programmed cell death protein 1 or anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 is currently unknown. We determined the HLA-I genotype of 1535 advanced cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Maximal heterozygosity at HLA-I loci ("A," "B," and "C") improved overall survival after ICB compared with patients who were homozygous for at least one HLA locus. In two independent melanoma cohorts, patients with the HLA-B44 supertype had extended survival, whereas the HLA-B62 supertype (including HLA-B*15:01) or somatic loss of heterozygosity at HLA-I was associated with poor outcome. Molecular dynamics simulations of HLA-B*15:01 revealed different elements that may impair CD8+ T cell recognition of neoantigens. Our results have important implications for predicting response to ICB and for the design of neoantigen-based therapeutic vaccines.},

abstract = {Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies, which potentiate the body's natural immune response against tumor cells, have shown immense promise in the treatment of various cancers. Currently, tumor mutational burden (TMB) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression are the primary biomarkers evaluated for clinical management of cancer patients across histologies. However, the wide range of responses has demonstrated that the specific molecular and genetic characteristics of each patient's tumor and immune system must be considered to maximize treatment efficacy. Here, we review the various biological pathways and emerging biomarkers implicated in response to PD-(L)1 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) therapies, including oncogenic signaling pathways, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) variability, mutation and neoantigen burden, microbiome composition, endogenous retroviruses (ERV), and deficiencies in chromatin remodeling and DNA damage repair (DDR) machinery. We also discuss several mechanisms that have been observed to confer resistance to ICB, such as loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), loss of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I/II expression, and activation of the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF$\beta$) pathways. Clinical trials testing the combination of PD-(L)1 or CTLA-4 blockade with molecular mediators of these pathways are becoming more common and may hold promise for improving treatment efficacy and response. Ultimately, some of the genes and molecular mechanisms highlighted in this review may serve as novel biological targets or therapeutic vulnerabilities to improve clinical outcomes in patients.},

Here, we address this question in the context of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) by integrating whole genome sequencing with single-cell RNA-sequencing (using the 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell 5' Gene Expression workflow). Applying this approach to five cryopreserved AML samples, we identify hundreds to thousands of cells containing tumor-specific mutations in each case, and use the results to distinguish AML cells (including normal-karyotype AML cells) from normal cells, identify expression signatures associated with subclonal mutations, and find cell surface markers that could be used to purify subclones for further study. This integrative approach for connecting genotype to phenotype is broadly applicable to any sample that is phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous.},

abstract = {The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and class II loci are the most polymorphic genes in the human genome, with a highly clustered and patchwork pattern of sequence motifs. In the three decades since the first HLA gene was isolated by molecular cloning (a cDNA clone of HLA-B7), thousands of alleles have been identified and the names and sequences of all known alleles have been curated in the IMGT/HLA database. This extensive allelic diversity made and continues to make high-resolution HLA DNA typing very challenging. The first attempt at HLA DNA typing involved restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, but this approach had many limitations. The development of PCR in 1985 allowed for the amplification of the polymorphic exons of the HLA class I and class II genes and the analysis of the polymorphic sequence motifs with sequence-specific oligonucleotide (SSO) hybridization probes. The immobilization of these probes on membranes and later on beads, along with primer sets for sequence-specific priming (SSP), gave rise to the current set of HLA typing reagents. Sanger sequencing has provided high-resolution typing but, in many cases, genotyping 'ambiguity' remains an issue. In the past few years, the introduction of next-generation sequencing, with the critical properties of massively parallel and clonal sequencing, has significantly reduced HLA genotyping ambiguity. Here, our lab's efforts to develop high-resolution and high-throughput HLA DNA typing using the 454 Sequencing System are reviewed, and the potential future developments and applications of HLA DNA typing are discussed.},

After demonstrating improvement over existing methods for integrating scRNA-seq data, we anchor scRNA-seq experiments with scATAC-seq to explore chromatin differences in closely related interneuron subsets and project protein expression measurements onto a bone marrow atlas to characterize lymphocyte populations. Lastly, we harmonize in situ gene expression and scRNA-seq datasets, allowing transcriptome-wide imputation of spatial gene expression patterns.

abstract = {Immune evasion is a hallmark of cancer. Losing the ability to present neoantigens through human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loss may facilitate immune evasion. However, the polymorphic nature of the locus has precluded accurate HLA copy-number analysis. Here, we present loss of heterozygosity in human leukocyte antigen (LOHHLA), a computational tool to determine HLA allele-specific copy number from sequencing data. Using LOHHLA, we find that HLA LOH occurs in 40{\%} of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) and is associated with a high subclonal neoantigen burden, APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis, upregulation of cytolytic activity, and PD-L1 positivity. The focal nature of HLA LOH alterations, their subclonal frequencies, enrichment in metastatic sites, and occurrence as parallel events suggests that HLA LOH is an immune escape mechanism that is subject to strong microenvironmental selection pressures later in tumor evolution. Characterizing HLA LOH with LOHHLA refines neoantigen prediction and may have implications for our understanding of resistance mechanisms and immunotherapeutic approaches targeting neoantigens.

abstract = {BACKGROUND The presentation of HLA peptide complexes to T cells is a highly regulated and tissue specific process involving multiple transcriptionally controlled cellular components. The extensive polymorphism of HLA genes and the complex composition of the proteasome make it difficult to map their expression profiles across tissues. METHODS Here we applied a tailored gene quantification pipeline to 4323 publicly available RNA-Seq datasets representing 55 normal tissues and cell types to examine expression profiles of (classical and non-classical) HLA class I, class II and proteasomal genes. RESULTS We generated the first comprehensive expression atlas of antigen presenting-related genes across 56 normal tissues and cell types, including immune cells, pancreatic islets, platelets and hematopoietic stem cells. We found a surprisingly heterogeneous HLA expression pattern with up to 100-fold difference in intra-tissue median HLA abundances. Cells of the immune system and lymphatic organs expressed the highest levels of classical HLA class I (HLA-A,-B,-C), class II (HLA-DQA1,-DQB1,-DPA1,-DPB1,-DRA,-DRB1) and non-classical HLA class I (HLA-E,-F) molecules, whereas retina, brain, muscle, megakaryocytes and erythroblasts showed the lowest abundance. In contrast, we identified a distinct and highly tissue-restricted expression pattern of the non-classical class I gene HLA-G in placenta, pancreatic islets, pituitary gland and testis. While the constitutive proteasome showed relatively constant expression across all tissues, we found the immunoproteasome to be enriched in lymphatic organs and almost absent in immune privileged tissues. CONCLUSIONS Here, we not only provide a reference catalog of tissue and cell type specific HLA expression, but also highlight extremely variable expression of the basic components of antigen processing and presentation in different cell types. Our findings indicate that low expression of classical HLA class I molecules together with lack of immunoproteasome components as well as upregulation of HLA-G may be of key relevance to maintain tolerance in immune privileged tissues.},

However, whether the T cell response to checkpoint blockade relies on reinvigoration of pre-existing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes or on recruitment of novel T cells remains unclear2–4. Here we performed paired single-cell RNA and T cell receptor sequencing on 79,046 cells from site-matched tumors from patients with basal or squamous cell carcinoma before and after anti-PD-1 therapy. Tracking T cell receptor clones and transcriptional phenotypes revealed coupling of tumor recognition, clonal expansion and T cell dysfunction marked by clonal expansion of CD8+CD39+ T cells, which co-expressed markers of chronic T cell activation and exhaustion. However, the expansion of T cell clones did not derive from pre-existing tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes; instead, the expanded clones consisted of novel clonotypes that had not previously been observed in the same tumor. Clonal replacement of T cells was preferentially observed in exhausted CD8+ T cells and evident in patients with basal or squamous cell carcinoma. These results demonstrate that pre-existing tumor-specific T cells may have limited reinvigoration capacity, and that the T cell response to checkpoint blockade derives from a distinct repertoire of T cell clones that may have just recently entered the tumor.},

abstract = {The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system is a genomic region involved in regulating the human immune system by encoding cell membrane major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins that are responsible for self-recognition. Understanding the variation in this region provides important insights into autoimmune disorders, disease susceptibility, oncological immunotherapy, regenerative medicine, transplant rejection, and toxicogenomics. Traditional approaches to HLA typing are low throughput, target only a few genes, are labor intensive and costly, or require specialized protocols. RNA sequencing promises a relatively inexpensive, high-throughput solution for HLA calling across all genes, with the bonus of complete transcriptome information and widespread availability of historical data. Existing tools have been limited in their ability to accurately and comprehensively call HLA genes from RNA-seq data. We created HLAProfiler (
                    https://github.com/ExpressionAnalysis/HLAProfiler
                    
                  ), a k-mer profile-based method for HLA calling in RNA-seq data which can identify rare and common HLA alleles with {\textgreater} 99{\%} accuracy at two-field precision in both biological and simulated data. For 68{\%} of novel alleles not present in the reference database, HLAProfiler can correctly identify the two-field precision or exact coding sequence, a significant advance over existing algorithms. HLAProfiler allows for accurate HLA calls in RNA-seq data, reliably expanding the utility of these data in HLA-related research and enabling advances across a broad range of disciplines. Additionally, by using the observed data to identify potential novel alleles and update partial alleles, HLAProfiler will facilitate further improvements to the existing database of reference HLA alleles. HLAProfiler is available at

abstract = {We developed a novel human leukocyte antigen HLA-ABC locus-specific quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine the locus-specific gene expression of HLA-ABC in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs, n = 53), colon mucosa (n = 15), and larynx mucosa (n = 15). Laser-assisted tissue microdissection allowed us to study the selected cells without interference from surrounding stroma. We report evidence on the specificity of the technique, describing the HLA-ABC locus-specific gene expression patterns found in the PBLs and two solid tissues studied. PBLs showed a higher gene expression of HLA-B than of HLA-A or HLA-C (p = 4.7 × 10(-10) and p = 1.6 × 10(-6), respectively). In solid tissue, HLA-A and HLA-B gene expressions were similar and HLA-C expression lower. In particular, in larynx mucosa, significant differences were found between HLA-A and HLA-C expressions and between HLA-B and HLA-C expressions (p = 6.5 × 10(-4) and p = 8.1 × 10(-4), respectively). The same differences were observed in colon mucosa, but significance was not reached (p = 0.08 and p = 0.06, respectively). Differences in locus-specific regulation may be related to the control of cytotoxic responses of NK and CD8 positive T cells. Gene expression of HLA-ABC specific locus showed no intra-individual variability, but there was a high inter-individual variability. This may result from differences in the expression of common regulatory factors that control HLA-ABC constitutive expression.},

abstract = {MHC class I proteins are partly responsible for shaping the magnitude and focus of the adaptive cellular immune response. In humans, conventional wisdom suggests that the HLA-A, -B, and -C alleles are equally expressed on the majority of cell types. While we currently have a thorough understanding of how total MHC class I expression varies in different tissues, it has been difficult to examine expression of single MHC class I alleles due to the homogeneity of MHC class I sequences. It is unclear how cDNA species are expressed in distinct cell subsets in humans and particularly in macaques which transcribe upwards of 20 distinct MHC class I alleles at variable levels. We examined MHC gene expression in human and macaque leukocyte subsets. In humans, while we detected overall differences in locus transcription, we found that transcription of MHC class I genes was consistent across the leukocyte subsets we studied with only small differences detected. In contrast, transcription of certain MHC cDNA species in macaques varied dramatically by up to 45{\%} between different subsets. Although the Mafa-B*134:02 RNA is virtually undetectable in CD4+ T cells, it represents over 45{\%} of class I transcripts in CD14+ monocytes. We observed parallel MHC transcription differences in rhesus macaques. Finally, we analyzed expression of select MHC proteins at the cell surface using fluorescent peptides. This technique confirmed results from the transcriptional analysis and demonstrated that other MHC proteins, known to restrict SIV-specific responses, are also differentially expressed among distinct leukocyte subsets. We assessed MHC class I transcription and expression in human and macaque leukocyte subsets. Until now, it has been difficult to examine MHC class I allele expression due to the similarity of MHC class I sequences. Using two novel techniques we showed that expression varies among distinct leukocyte subsets of macaques but does not vary dramatically in the human cell subsets we examined. These findings suggest pathogen tropism may have a profound impact on the shape and focus of the MHC class I restricted CD8+ T cell response in macaques.},

Methods We performed enhanced exome sequencing on paired samples obtained at initial presentation with AML and at relapse from 15 patients who had a relapse after hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (with transplants from an HLA-matched sibling, HLA-matched unrelated donor, or HLA-mismatched unrelated donor) and from 20 patients who had a relapse after chemotherapy.

abstract = {The HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigens) genes are well-documented targets of balancing selection, and variation at these loci is associated with many disease phenotypes. Variation in expression levels also influences disease susceptibility and resistance, but little information exists about the regulation and population-level patterns of expression. This results from the difficulty in mapping short reads originated from these highly polymorphic loci, and in accounting for the existence of several paralogues. We developed a computational pipeline to accurately estimate expression for HLA genes based on RNA-seq, improving both locus-level and allele-level estimates. First, reads are aligned to all known HLA sequences in order to infer HLA genotypes, then quantification of expression is carried out using a personalized index. We use simulations to show that expression estimates obtained in this way are not biased due to divergence from the reference genome. We applied our pipeline to the GEUVADIS dataset, and compared the quantifications to those obtained with reference transcriptome. Although the personalized pipeline recovers more reads, we found that using the reference transcriptome produces estimates similar to the personalized pipeline (r ≥ 0.87) with the exception of HLA-DQA1. We describe the impact of the HLA-personalized approach on downstream analyses for nine classical HLA loci (HLA-A, HLA-C, HLA-B, HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1). Although the influence of the HLA-personalized approach is modest for eQTL mapping, the p-values and the causality of the eQTLs obtained are better than when the reference transcriptome is used. We investigate how the eQTLs we identified explain variation in expression among lineages of HLA alleles. Finally, we discuss possible causes underlying differences between expression estimates obtained using RNA-seq, antibody-based approaches and qPCR.},

abstract = {Virtually all tumors are genetically heterogeneous, containing subclonal populations of cells that are defined by distinct mutations[1][1]. Subclones can have unique phenotypes that influence disease progression[2][2], but these phenotypes are difficult to characterize: subclones usually cannot be physically purified, and bulk gene expression measurements obscure interclonal differences. Single-cell RNA-sequencing has revealed transcriptional heterogeneity within a variety of tumor types, but it is unclear how this expression heterogeneity relates to subclonal genetic events – for example, whether particular expression clusters correspond to mutationally defined subclones[3][3],[4][4],[5][5],[6][6]-[9][7]. To address this question, we developed an approach that integrates enhanced whole genome sequencing (eWGS) with the 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell 5' Gene Expression workflow (scRNA-seq) to directly link expressed mutations with transcriptional profiles at single cell resolution. Using bone marrow samples from five cases of primary human Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), we generated WGS and scRNA-seq data for each case. Duplicate single cell libraries representing a median of 20,474 cells per case were generated from the bone marrow of each patient. Although the libraries were 5' biased, we detected expressed mutations in cDNAs at distances up to 10 kbp from the 5' ends of well-expressed genes, allowing us to identify hundreds to thousands of cells with AML-specific somatic mutations in every case. This data made it possible to distinguish AML cells (including normal-karyotype AML cells) from surrounding normal cells, to study tumor differentiation and intratumoral expression heterogeneity, to identify expression signatures associated with subclonal mutations, and to find cell surface markers that could be used to purify subclones for further study. The data also revealed transcriptional heterogeneity that occurred independently of subclonal mutations, suggesting that additional factors drive epigenetic heterogeneity. This integrative approach for connecting genotype to phenotype in AML cells is broadly applicable for analysis of any sample that is phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous.

abstract = {Detecting genetic variants that are highly divergent from a reference sequence remains a major challenge in genome sequencing. We introduce de novo assembly algorithms using colored de Bruijn graphs for detecting and genotyping simple and complex genetic variants in an individual or population. We provide an efficient software implementation, Cortex, the first de novo assembler capable of assembling multiple eukaryotic genomes simultaneously. Four applications of Cortex are presented. First, we detect and validate both simple and complex structural variations in a high-coverage human genome. Second, we identify more than 3 Mb of sequence absent from the human reference genome, in pooled low-coverage population sequence data from the 1000 Genomes Project. Third, we show how population information from ten chimpanzees enables accurate variant calls without a reference sequence. Last, we estimate classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes at HLA-B, the most variable gene in the human genome.},

@article{NOCITE,
abstract = {Immunotherapies that block inhibitory checkpoint receptors on T cells have transformed the clinical care of cancer patients. However, which tumor-specific T cells are mobilized following checkpoint blockade remains unclear. Here, we performed paired single-cell RNA- and T cell receptor (TCR)-sequencing on 79,046 cells from site-matched tumors from patients with basal cell carcinoma (BCC) or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) pre- and post-anti-PD-1 therapy. Tracking TCR clones and transcriptional phenotypes revealed a coupling of tumor-recognition, clonal expansion, and T cell dysfunction: the T cell response to treatment was accompanied by clonal expansions of CD8+CD39+ T cells, which co-expressed markers of chronic T cell activation and exhaustion. However, this expansion did not derive from pre-existing tumor infiltrating T cell clones; rather, it comprised novel clonotypes, which were not previously observed in the same tumor. Clonal replacement of T cells was preferentially observed in exhausted CD8+ T cells, compared to other distinct T cell phenotypes, and was evident in BCC and SCC patients. These results, enabled by single-cell multi-omic profiling of clinical samples, demonstrate that pre-existing tumor-specific T cells may be limited in their capacity for re-invigoration, and that the T cell response to checkpoint blockade relies on the expansion of a distinct repertoire of T cell clones that may have just recently entered the tumor.},
